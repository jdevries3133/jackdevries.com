  After graduating with a B.M. in Music Education and Jazz Studies from William
  Paterson University of New Jersey in January 2020, I started working as a
  music teacher in K-12 schools. I have enjoyed that work a lot, but I've also
  spent time close to the problems in our education system. To be honest, it is
  my lifelong dream to have a broad and positive impact on education, but I know
  that grinding out a 30-year career in the classroom is not necessarily the
  only path towards that goal.
