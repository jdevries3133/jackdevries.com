# Zero to Hero Vim Tutorial

The goal of this post is to be a roadmap that can help someone with effectively
zero vim or neovim knowledge work up to the full neovim-as-an IDE experience.

I won't try to persuade you to learn (neo)vim, but I'll just say that using
(neo)vim brings me immeasurable joy each day, and I hope that everyone can
experience the mind-tool connection that it provides. There are a lot of false
prophets of vim who say it will make you faster or give you some other
superhuman benefits. Vim can probably be a pathway to speed and throughput as a
developer, but it can also be a subject of tinkering which ultimately slows you
down!

To me, using neovim at its best feels like playing a musical instrument. It
elicits a flow state and drives my focus through the day, but most of all, it
just makes me happy. To that end, I hope that this guide helps you join me.

## `vim` vs `neovim`

As a newcomer, which editor to use, which plugins to choose, and the overall
path from zero to hero are muddy waters. From a user's perspective, neovim is
almost 100% compatible with vim for all intents and purposes. That assertion
breaks down once we start looking at plugins, but the overall user experience
_before_ plugins is comparable. To that end, it doesn't really matter which one
you start with, although I'm going to introduce vim with a much simpler
configuration setup as a stepping stone to my IDE-like neovim setup.

Neovim has applied massive architectural changes compared to vim, and
neovim has added the lua scripting language as a successor to vim script.
Neovim is also a community-led open source project, whereas vim follows the
so-called "benevolent dictator for life" model, where vim's founder Bram
Moolenaar makes final decisions about the future of the project, for
[better or worse.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29758549)

In any case, neovim's architectural improvements combined with lua as a
first-class scripting language have made extremely sophisticated plugins
easier to develop than ever, and the community is bustling to say the least. At
this point, popular neovim plugins are polished, consistent, and extremely
performant. Not only that, but since they're all implemented in neovim-flavored
lua, they provide APIs for extension, which means that plugin authors can
collaborate and rely on each others' plugins. It's truly the best of the open
source ecosystem at work.

I don't want to give plain old vim the cold shoulder, though. One of the
delightful things about going down the (neo)vim learning journey is that you
apparently never stop finding features that are both surprising and quirky, and
in my experience, a lot of these nuggets of gold are inherited from vim. For
example:

- Did you know that `g?<motion>` will rot13 encode text?
- Did you know that `gu<motion>` and `gU<motion>`, can convert
  text to lowercase or uppercase, respectively?
- Did you know you can open and edit a remote file without leaving vim with `:e
  scp://<user>@<host>//absolute/path/to/file.txt`
- Did you know that you can yank (`y`), change (`c`), or delete (`d`) text
  inside curly braces, parenthesis, or square braces with key sequences like:
  - `di{`: delete inside curly braces
  - `ci(`: change inside parenthesis
  - `yi[`: yank inside square brackets
  - `p`, intuitively, will paste (or "`put`") that text where the cursor is
    after yanking

That is a random smattering of functionality, but the idea that there are so
many random fun things like this to learn, and that they are available on every
Unix-like terminal you touch is the legacy of vim (and vi that came before).
I definitely don't sleep on plain-old vim. That being said, neovim has all this
and more!

## My Configurations

My vim config aims to be minimal and portable. There are some plugins, but
there is also a single fully-portable `common.vim` file that can be scp'd onto
to any remote machine to quickly bring a base-level of comfort.

My neovim config, on the other hand, has all the bells and whistles: fuzzy
finder, live grep, integrated debugger, language support, dynamically inlined
lint errors, intelligent syntax highlighting and folding, and more.

You can find each, with setup instructions, on my GitHub:

- [my vim config](https://github.com/jdevries3133/vim_config)
- [my neovim config](https://github.com/jdevries3133/nvim_config)

## Transitioning to (neo)vim

In my view, it's best done as a three step process which I'll now lay out:

1. Use a plugin for your current editor to learn the vim shortcuts
2. Use vim itself with a minimal config
3. Optionally, use neovim with an IDE-like config _(if that's your cup of tea)_

## Step 1: Editor Plugin

The thing that killed me about trying to learn vim was trying to figure out how
to navigate _between_ files while also becoming comfortable with all of the
many editing commands. I think that doing both of these things at the same time
is overwhelming, and there's no reason to do that to yourself. Visual Studio
Code has a [vim
plugin,](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) and
so does the whole [jetbrains IDE
family.](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) Whatever editor
you're comfortable with probably has one too, and it's a great place to start.

Most vim editor plugins will make your IDE modal in the same way that vim is,
and give you the same keyboard shortcuts for manipulating text and moving
between editing modes. However, editor plugins stop at the vim-text-editing
experience (arguably the best part of vim). For all of your other development
tasks, the IDE is still there for you in all the ways it normally is. This is
like vim training wheels, and I it's fair to say that you will be much more
successful with the real thing after the key mappings for regular editing
become second-nature. To that end, there's no shame in honing your skills in
this phase for three to six months.

### Configuring Editor Plugins

Most of the benefit of editor plugins is that you can get started without going
crazy on configuration, but I do have one suggestion.

Some people are bothered by needing to constantly reach for the escape key,
including myself. If you are interested in mapping escape to some other key or
key combination, now is a great time to do that. Personally, I map `jk` to
`<Esc>`. You can achieve that with the VSCode vim plugin like this

```json
"vim.insertModeKeyBindings": [
  {
    "before": ["j", "k"],
    "after": ["<Esc>"]
  }
],
```

If you want this behavior for vim and neovim, you can use this bash snippet:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim

config="inoremap jk <Esc>
tnoremap jk <C-\><C-n>"

echo $config >> ~/.vimrc
echo $config >> $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/init.vim
```

Beyond that, this is your opportunity to learn "the vim way," of editing text.
Vim is like a programming language for text transformation – try to avoid
creating excessive mappings unless you're certain that there is no other way.
Check out my [other post all about editing text in vim](./vimEditing.mdx)

## Step 2: vim

You already know the basics of editing text, but transitioning towards using
"real" vim means that you're going to learn some more "meta" vim concepts:

- configuration
- buffers
- windows
- tabs
- terminal emulator
- file explorer

Each of these concepts support you in navigating codebases and doing getting
development work done with vim, and go beyond the basic text editing shortcuts.

For now, you're going to have a more text-editor-like experience, and you might
even prefer to use vim and your previous tool of choice alternatively.
Certainly, if you make heavy use of language support features or linters, a
no-nonsense vim setup might not suit your needs excellently, but this is a
transition period. My neovim configuration, which is the last step of this
roadmap, includes all that stuff. So, consider skipping ahead if you can't make
do without linting errors, jump-to-definition, etc.

Just be **warned,** it is surprising how productive plain vim is without all
those bells and whistles. Programmers were using vim as a professional tool in
the 1990s, and they built plenty of workflows to solve a programmer's problems
in the text editor without introducing complexity. You'd be remiss not to learn
the true "vim" way. Not only that, but you might find that [your problem with
vim is that you don't grok vi!]( https://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118)

### Configuration

Let's keep it simple: I have a [basic vim config on
github](https://github.com/jdevries3133/vim_config) which represents a good
place to start. If you simply [look at the `plugins.vim` file to see which
plugins are included,](https://github.com/jdevries3133/vim_config/blob/main/plugins.vim)
you'll see that there are _very_ few, and that is on purpose: keep trying to do
things the "vim" way, and use plugins when you're sure there isn't another way
to do what you're trying to do.

Fork my config, follow the directions for how to install it, and it'll have you
up and running without much bloat.

### Buffers

A buffer in vim represents an open file. By default, vim will close buffers
anytime you navigate away from a file, and warn you if it's unsaved, but if you
have `set hidden` in your config, then buffers persist in the background and
they can persist in an unsaved state. Aside from storing any unsaved changes,
buffers also keep track of the position of your cursor in the file, so that
you'll pick up right where you left off.

You can view all the buffers you have open with the `:ls` command. You'll see
that each buffer has a unique id, and you can go directly to any open buffer
with `:b <id>`. You can also type the name of the file, and vim will offer
completion options if you press tab; for example, `:b my_text_file.txt`. This
comes in handy if you have a terminal open in the background. In vim,
background terminals have the name of your shell, so the buffer name will often
be `/bin/bash`. So, you can consistently jump to a background terminal with `:b
bash<tab>`. Similarly, in neovim, terminals start with `term://...`, so you can
jump to them with `:b ter<tab>`.

Sometimes, you might have unsaved changes in a hidden buffer, in which case vim
will try to prevent you from quitting without saving, showing the following
message:

```text
E162: No write since last change for buffer "..."
```

If you want to quit anyway, you can use `:q!`. Or, if you want to write to all
buffers, including hidden ones, you can use `:wa` (`:wall`).

Vim will keep track of the last buffer you were editing, and you can toggle
back and forth between two buffers with `C-^` (control + ^).

There are a lot of resources all about vim buffers online that go into more
detail, but never forget that vim's build-in help can be a great resource for
information. Just type [`:help
buffers.`](https://vimhelp.org/windows.txt.html#buffers)

### Windows

`:split` or `:vsplit` can be used to split your vim screen into two windows,
either horizontally or vertically, respectively. This is super useful because
you can look at two files side-by-side! I often find myself falling into a
4-panel layout if I'm really multitasking, which is way more files than I'm
comfortably able to look at in VS Code – that's the beauty of not having any
visible user interface!

<Image
  src="/static/vimWindowExample.webp"
  alt="image showing vim with multiple windows"
  caption="This is actually a real world example! I opened up 3 windows to figure out how to use this image component: this post's source is on the left, the import I needed to copy is on the top right, and the previous usage of this component is in the bottom right."
/>

Windows are key for any sort of serious productivity in vim, and you'll
certainly interact with them a lot. You'll see some
[shortcuts in my vim config](https://github.com/jdevries3133/vim_config/blob/5d6b864a644d81eae4f953cabee13b09dd0dcfbf/common.vim#L31-L35):
to help with vim windows:

```
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l
nnoremap <C-c> <C-w>c
```

Normally, to interact with windows, you have to type `<C-w>` ("control + w"),
then the "action" key. These are the default mappings:

- `<C-w>`, then `h` to move left
- `<C-w>`, then `j` to move down
- `<C-w>`, then `k` to move up
- `<C-w>`, then `l` to move right
- `<C-w>`, then `c` to close the current window

These mappings make it so that you don't need to do so much typing to move
between windows!

- `<C-h>`: move left
- `<C-j>`: move down
- `<C-k>`: move up
- `<C-l>`: move right
- `<C-c>`: close the current window

So, to simplify all of that, you can just hold down "control," and then use
those same fundamental vim movement keys (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to switch between
windows. Putting everything together, your typical vim-window workflow looks
like this:

1. use `:vs` or `:sp` to split the current window
2. use `:e <file>`, or `:b <buffer>`, or some other command to switch to a
   different file for one of those windows
