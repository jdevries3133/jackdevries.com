# Docker Learning Resources

Here is a collection of resources that are useful for learning about docker,
from the ground up.

## What are Containers?

- [guide from docker's website](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)
- [deep dive on Linux kernel tech that underpins containers from Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/overview_of_containers_in_red_hat_systems/introduction_to_linux_containers)

## Docker CLI

- [overview of docker
  commands](https://linuxhandbook.com/essential-docker-commands/)
- [docker's docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/)

## Docker Experiments

Quick demos that show what you can do with the docker CLI alone

[Startup a new mysql server locally](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) _see "How
to use this image" section

Run a redis server locally & attach to it with just 1 line:

```bash
docker run -it --rm redis redis-cli -h some-redis
```

Print out the `resolv.conf` for Ubuntu:latest

```bash
docker run ubuntu:latest cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Run a local python script inside an Alpine container instead of on your own
machine.

```bash
echo "print('hello, world!')" > main.py
docker run -v $(pwd)/main.py:/main.py python:3-alpine python3 main.py
```
