# Vim `:grep` on Steriods with Ripgrep

This one goes out to the vim users who like to keep it simple. Not really
myself -- my neovim config is currently sitting pretty at 8187 lines -- but
smarter people who seek to avoid that level of suffering might like this trick.

## Background

If you're a vim minimalist, you're probably already acquainted with `:grep`:

    :grep -rn "whatever" directory

Behind the scenes, this uses whatever `grep` is installed on your machine; it's
an interface for calling external grep-like programs. There's also `:vimgrep`,
which is built into vim and uses a sed-like syntax familiar to vim users. It's
much slower albeit more feature rich with vim integration, but basically works
the same. This is all fine and good and built in to vim; you can search for
matches on the "whatever" pattern for all the files in "directory." The problem
is that this will also search through `node_modules`, `venv`, and all the other
generated not-source-code crap that tends to accumulate in source trees.

## ripgrep

In neovim, I've been using ripgrep + Telescope to solve this problem for a
while. [Ripgrep](https://github.com/jdevries3133/vim_config/blob/main/vimrc) is
itself a spiritual successor to [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/why-ack/). Both of
these tools attempt to be "grep for developers." They are natively aware of
version control. They skip searching through the `.git` folder, and also
acknowledge all the `.gitignore` files in a file tree. They have other
niceties, but those two are the most important, because they "just work" for
searching through source trees, with no false positives!

Install ripgrep and try it out on a version-controlled source tree; the
installed program is called "rg" not "ripgrep!" Let's consider a javascript
example.

    rg react

You'll notice that the results are only files in your source tree;
`node_modules` is excluded by default since it's in the `.gitignore`!

## ripgrep + vim

Now, to integrate with vim, it's really simple, just add this snippet to your
`.vimrc`:

```vim
set grepprg=rg\ --vimgrep\ --no-heading\ --smart-case
set grepformat=%f:%l:%c:%m,%f:%l:%m
```

[source](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/425#issuecomment-381446152)

"`grepprg ...`" tells vim to use ripgrep. `grepformat ...` changes the output
format so that vim can parse it into its
[quickfixlist](https://vimhelp.org/quickfix.txt.html#quickfix.txt).

### Sidenote: The Quickfixlist

Again, `:grep` now only searches through version control and, *critically*, it
will populate vim's quickfixlist with the results of a search. The quickfixlist
is fantastic. Its name comes from the fact that it was originally conceived as
an integration between vim and make / Makefiles. Basically, it would parse the
error output from your C compiler and give you a "quick fix list;" the list of
locations you needed to quickly go to in your editor to make fixes! Since the
`:q` namespace is cluttered, most quickfix commands start with `:c` instead:

- `:cn[ext]`: jump to next item
- `:cp[revious]`: jump to the previous item
- `:copen`: open the quickfix list in a draw at the bottom

[Freshman.tech](https://freshman.tech/vim-quickfix-and-location-list/) has a
detailed write-up on the quickfixlist that goes into some more detail.

### Bringing it all together: ripgrep, quickfixlist, and `:cdo`

The most significant superpower, though, comes from combining ripgrep, the
quickfixlist, and vim's substitution power. Let's imagine that we're renaming a
source file. We want to similarly update every import statement in a codebase.

#### Step 1: Find every import statement of that source file

 ```vim
 :grep "from ['\"].*myOldSourceFile['\"];?"
 ```
This matches every possibility for javascript or typescript ES6 imports:

- `from '/path/to/myOldSourceFile'`
- `from "../../relative/path/to/myOldSourceFile'`

It doesn't match `'myOldSourceFile.tsx'`; although a sane codebase would have
that. Your mileage may vary - no two javascript codebases are the same.

#### Step 2: Craft the substitution command

I'm not a regex genius, but with `:incsearch`, you can incrementally craft
quite complex regular expressions with immediate visual feedback. Here's an
example; the source file might look familiar üòÅ. A video is worth 1000 words in
this case.

In this example, the expression is really quite simple, though!

```vim
s/myOldSourceFile/myNewSourceFile
```

#### Step 3: Use `:cdo`

This is where the magic happens! With `:cdo`, you can apply a command to every
line in your quickfixlist!

```vim
:grep "from ['\"].*myOldSourceFile['\"];?"
:cdo s/myOldSourceFile/myNewSourceFile
```

You may have just successfully updated hundreds of files in about 1 minute of
effort. Or, you may have caused a catastrophe! That's what `git checkout -- .`
is for. It goes without saying that doing this sort of thing with many unstaged
changes on your working tree is a recipe for disaster!

#### Other Useful Patterns

I have used this for updating dozens of webpack configurations in one fell
swoop:

```vim
:grep "entry: .*"
:cdo s/entry: \(.*\)/\0\r  newConfiguration: {\r    someValue: true\r},
```

In this case, I'm using some existing part of the file as an anchor, and just
adding more stuff. In vim, you can use `\r` in the replace side of a
substitution pattern to add a newline.

### Why Not `:vimgrep`

Considering the 3-step use case I shared before, I believe that `:vimgrep` is
somewhat suited towards doing all of that in a single step. I honestly haven't
used it much, and I don't doubt that it could be better. Let me know if that's
the case! I do feel like when I'm doing sweeping find and replace operations, I
want to do it in a 2-step process anyway. First, I `:grep` to populate the
quickfixlist, and I might iterate on the grep pattern until I have exactly the
search results that I want. Then, only when I'm confident that the results are
correct, I'll start working on the transformation with `:cdo`.
