# Cross Compilation from M1 Mac for Rust Projects

I had a really hard time Googling for answers to questions about cross
compilation *from* an M1 mac, because historically there have been so many
questions about compiling **from** `x86_64` **to** `arm`; mostly in the
embedded systems space.

I hope that I've thrown in enough keywords to bring people with the same
problem as myself here:

> I just want to compile my app on my mac and ship it to a Linux box running an
> `x86_64` architecture and I am struggling.

### Helpful Resources

- [Cross-compiling Rust from ARM to x86-64 by Bryan Burgers](https://burgers.io/cross-compile-rust-from-arm-to-x86-64)
- [Cross-compilation from the Rust Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/cross-compilation.html)
- [`rustc` platform support docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html)

The first resource, in particular, was most helpful to me, so I reduced it into
a bash snippet.

### *The* Snippet

This will setup tooling and cross-compile an `x86_64` executable from your M1
Mac.

<CodeSample>
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# musl is a version of the C standard library that can be statically linked
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# see https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains
brew tap messense/macos-cross-toolchains
brew install x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
echo "export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc
export CXX_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-g++
export AR_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-ar
export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc" \
    >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

echo "[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = \"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc\"" >> ~/.cargo/config

# ---
# tooling setup is done
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```
</CodeSample>

<p className="my-0 py-0 text-center">caveats</p>

- you need to [install homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- this assumes the use of bash and appends to `~/.bashrc`
- this is assumed to be run in the root of a Rust project, because it ends with
  cross-compiling a rust project

</div>

You now have a working cross-compiled executable in
`target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` send it off to live its best x86_64 life!
