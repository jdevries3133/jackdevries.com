# One Branch to Rule Them All

For about 2 months now, I've been using 1 development branch at work.

Yes, one. "`git checkout jack`" -- that's it.

How did I get here, why the hell am I doing this, how does it work, and is it
worth it?

## Companion Repo

[jdevries3133/one_branch_workflow_demo](https://github.com/jdevries3133/one_branch_workflow_demo)
is a tutorial for the git workflow I'll present here.

## Hard Problems

Git is a great thing, but there are some hard problems that used to seem
inescapable;

- How do I keep track of all of my work-in-progress changes, and their status
  towards being merged into the main branch?
- How can I ensure that all my development work stays up-to-date with the main
  branch?
- How do I work incrementally without blocking myself on code review?
- How do I reduce distraction, and maintain a flow state for longer?
- How do I increase the throughput with which my changes move through code
  review?
- How do I continue working on multiple changes with a single shared unmerged
  dependency, without scope-bloat, where all 3 changes meld into one inseprable
  blob?
- How can I engage with git for all that it's worth, so that it becomes a
  powerful tool for managing, partitioning, reordering, or even abandoning my
  own changes?
- How can I reduce the scope of total unmerged and unintegrated code across my
  development branches?

This is how I got here. I wasn't satisfied with how any of this stuff was
going.

## Big Feature, Inspiration

I had to work on a big feature. Many thousands of lines when all was said and
done. Lots of moving parts. Tight deadlines. Gotta go fast.

In the past, I used the feature branching strategy that we all know and love:

<Image
  src="/static/feature-branching.svg"
  alt="Visualization of feature branching"
/>

This works _all right,_ after all, it is what most developers do on a
day-to-day basis, so it can't be a totally broken workflow, but I'm sure
everyone feels this pain:

<Image
  src="/static/branchWorkflowOuch.svg"
  alt="Visualization of concurrent dependent changes, where things go wrong"
/>

But that's not so bad, you say, you need to finish the first form before
starting the second one anyway! Incrementalism is good; this is fine.

Except reality actually looks like this:

<Image
  src="/static/branchWorkflowExtraOuch.svg"
  alt="Visualization of concurrent dependent changes, where things go wrong"
/>

This double-red time, where code review is happening, and you are also not
wanting to continue work is the real killer. There are a few common places that
developers go from here, but I'd argue they are all bad solutions, for
different reasons.

### Bad Solution: Task Switch

Here's the easiest and most straightforward solution - when you have a unit of
changes ready to ship, switch to the next task. The problem here is that if
you practice incrementalism, you probably have a delivery-ready unit of changes
every 1 hour on average. Nonetheless, you probably don't enter into the code
review process once each hour because it's heavy and slow, and you know that if
you do so, you'll be slowed down, so you don't.

A further problem is that I'd argue it's not healthy to conflate the process of
spewing code from your brain and organizing code into change-sets. As
programmers, we need to take steps to harness our mind's [flow
state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Distractions are
poison, and even though you might not realize it, feature-branching is
poisoning your flow!

> Hm, I'm totally in the zone, but I'm starting to accumulate a lot of unstaged
> changes. Should I really start this refactor now, or should I wait for later.
> Oh look, there's a bug here - um, well, I won't fix it now, I'll just add it
> to my task list to die-- uh, I mean, I'm sure I'll get to it. Oh look, this
> formatting is messed up. Well, I don't want to bloat the diff, I'll just do
> that later.

That's a flow state about as smooth as black tar... What if, instead, you could
forget about these concerns, and fearlessly change whatever the hell you want
without screwing everything up?

### Bad Solution: Keep Adding Commits

This sort of works, but there should be some obvious drawbacks here. First, in
the spirit of true incrementalism, every pull request should be as small as
possible. As soon as you add 1 commit into one pull request that could have
been separated, I'd argue you're making a mistake and undermining the
likelihood that the change will be bug-free and successful.

More importantly, your reviewer is probably not a fan of this. It's possible to
add commits to a certain extent, but at some point the reviewer does need to
look at a stable set of changes, test them, and think about them. In other
words, when you're in the midst of the code review process, that branch really
doesn't belong to you, and you should keep it stable. Again, humans make tons
of mistakes and this is about giving everyone the best possible chance of
success. Your reviewer will miss more things if they're trying to review a
moving target.

### Bad Solution: Branch and Merge Your Heart Out

This is the best bad solution of them all. With a branching workflow, we can
have `feature_part_1`, `feature_part_2`, etc. If you add a commit to part 1
(code review feedback), you can simply merge it into part 2. When part 1 is
merged into master, you can merge master into part 2, and you'll be in a good
place.

The problem with branching strategies in git, though, is that they essentially
treat history as immutable, and I make too many mistakes for history to be
immutable. In the end, you're going to have tons of broken commits in your git
history, because every little fix is going to require a follow-up commit, and
the parent of that fix is a broken commit that will live on forever. If I did
this, I'd have more bad commits in git history than good ones, at which point
the history itself becomes useless. Not only that, but git history on the main
branch will include tons of revisions that were never in production. Do those
commits really matter for anyone after the code review is over?

If you want to be able to change history on your development branches, this
approach does not work.

## Enter: One-Branch Workflow

The good solution is to just use one branch. First, I'll do a deep dive on the
mechanics in case you're skeptical that this is possible. Then, I'll go through
the benefits. Here is what a day in the life of the one-branch workflow looks
like:

### Sidebar: `grbpr`

`grbpr` is an alias I have in my shell; it maps to:

```bash
# "git rebase for a pull request"
alias grbpr='git rebase -i $(git merge-base main HEAD)'
```

If that's confusing, check out
[jdevries3133/one_branch_workflow_demo](https://github.com/jdevries3133/one_branch_workflow_demo),
where it's broken down in detail.

#### Step 1: Absolute Chaos

You are now free to work as chaotically as you always wanted. You can make
temporary commits to save your work under a name, or, don't commit at all and
just work! The process of code writing is now decoupled from the actual changes
that are going to end up in code review, so it doesn't matter anymore, just
have fun! Fix docs, refactor as you go, and of course work on new features. The
unprecedented amount of freedom here is a main advantage to this workflow (but
not the only one).

#### Step 2: Reflect

Whether you've made small commits along the way or built up a glob of unstaged
changes, at some point you'll know it's time to take a step back and organize
your thoughts into commits. This time, the commits you're making are headed for
prod, so you might write some detailed commit messages and make final fixups as
needed.

#### Step 3: Code Review

To get a commit into code review is a simple process;

1. checkout from your dev branch to a feature branch, named after the commit
2. drop all commits except the one you intend to send to code review (via
   `grbpr`)
3. push to create a remote branch
4. open a merge request / pull request

#### Step 4: Feedback from Code Review

Often, in response to code review, you'll need to make some additional changes.
In this workflow;

1. checkout to your dev branch
2. make the changes
3. create a temporary, "fixup" commit
4. use `grbpr` to reorder commits so that the fixup is adjacent to the commit
   it's associated with, and squash the fixups into the feature commit
5. checkout to the feature branch (the one under code review)
6. hard-reset it to your dev branch
7. repeat step 3 - drop all commits except the one for this code review
8. force-push to update the code review branch

This step is a bit tedious, so I have some shell aliases to help me;

<CodeSample>
```bash
# for squashing fixups back into the commit they belong to
alias gfix='git add -A; git commit -m "fixup"; grbpr'

# "git sync" - for syncing the feature branch with your cannonical branch
function gs!() {
  git reset --hard jack # insert your dev branch name here
  grbpr
}
```
</CodeSample>

#### Step _always_: Sync with `main`

Technically, this happens continuously throughout the last 4 steps. To sync
your development branch with `main`, just run `git rebase main`. I do this
pretty much every time I blink.

Here, we encounter some more massive advantages to this workflow: visibility
over your own in-progress changes. Git will notify you when your commits have
merged into the main branch during rebase; it'll say something like, `warning:
skipped previously applied commit f899409`. You can `git show f899409` to see
what that commit is. More importantly, if you do `git log --oneline --graph`,
you can see all your in-progress work at a glance.

## Advantages

Now that the mechanics of the workflow have been spelled out, let's look back
at the problems stated in the beginning, and review the advantages of this
workflow.

### Keeping Track of In-Progress Work

`git log --oneline --graph` allows you to quickly visualize the commits on your
dev branch, which encapsulates all of your in-progress changes

```text
* 9173a83 (HEAD -> jack) feat: support for mermaid charts
* ef94456 fix: missing react key in navbar
*   3bb1a47 (origin/main, main) Merge pull request #63 from Code-the-Dream-School/newerRails
|\  
| * ef5c1ed prettier on newer md files
| * c06b434 get correct rails files
|/  
*   c5a16f1 Merge pull request #61 from Code-the-Dream-School/fixRailsAgain
```

At a glance, I can see that `ef94456` and `9173a83` are in-progress by looking
at the commits on my dev branch after `main`.

### Ensuring All Development Work is In-Sync with Main Branch

Feature branches that you're not working on quickly become stale, and getting a
random ping from a coworker to deal with a merge conflict breaks you out of
your flow. With this workflow, every time you `git rebase main`, you integrate
all of your changes with the main branch and immediately deal with any merge
conflicts that might have occurred. True, sometimes you'll forget to actually
update the downstream branch under code review, but that's now a quick and
simple process since you've already resolved the merge conflict.

### Working Incrementally without being Blocked on Code Review

Here's probably the raison d'etre for this workflow. You can send commits as
small as you want as frequently as you want to code review without ever slowing
down.

### Reduce Distractions, Improve Flow

This was discussed in "Step 1: Absolute Chaos." You can think of your dev
branch like a "work bench." It belongs to you, no one else will see it, and you
can put whatever you want on there. This decoupling of your working state and
the code review process means that you can stay focused on whatever you need to
be doing without worrying about how it impacts the code review process.

### Increase Throughput

If you work smaller you will move faster. I am an unapologetic CI/CD
evangelist. There is research like the State of DevOps Report to support that
high-performing engineering teams engage in CI/CD best practices, and that
shipping small changes as frequently as possible yields compounding benefits.

More concretely, small and atomic commits are way easier to review. If you send
your documentation changes in one commit, refactors in a few small patch
commits, then the backend for your feature with integration tests, then the
frontend for your feature with additional integration tests, each of those
commits are going to be very easy and straightforward to review. If you did
them all in one commit, it would be a nightmare.

Plus, if you did them all in one commit, the amount of time to get the changes
into prod is the time it takes to author the change PLUS the time it takes to
review. On the other hand, in the one-branch workflow, authorship and review
mostly happens concurrently. The documentation changes are reviewed and shipped
while you do the first refactoring. The first refactoring goes out the door
while as you're finishing up the second, etc.

### Complex Change Dependencies

Sometimes you can _almost_ separate a feature into 2 MRs, except that there's
some shared change that couples them together, and you're unable to achieve
separation, so you create a big heavy code review. Let's consider changes `A`,
`B`, and `C`, where `B`, and `C` depends on `A`;

```text
A -> B -> C

B depends on A
C depends on A
```

In this workflow, `A` goes into code review _as soon as it's done,_ and you can
continue working to start `B`. Certainly, until `A` merges, you can't open
merge requests for `B` or `C`, but you can continuously work on top of your
previous changes, such that building up complicated interdependent sequences of
patches becomes a breeze.

Not only that, but if you then author `D` having no dependencies, you can send
that to code review even though the interdependent cluster of `A -> B` and `A
-> C` is in your dev branch.

### Using Git for All It's Worth

In this workflow, I've had some staggering moments of understanding how awesome
git can be. If I see a change that I don't want to pursue, I can just drop the
commit. If I find a bug in a change, I can create a fix and squash back into a
historical commit. If I need to, I can reorder commits. I can go back to an old
commit and revise it, including splitting one old commit into 2 pieces! In this
workflow, git's power as a version control system benefits you personally in
your day-to-day work to control the chaos of your own in-flight changes.

### Reduce Scope of Overall Unintegrated Code

You dev branch represents all of the code you've authored that is in a pending
state. You can see it, and you can feel it. You can easily measure it's size.
You can take action to make it smaller if it starts to become too big.

# Conclusion

Surprisingly, the one-branch workflow is amazing albeit extremely
counter-intuitive. Whether or not you adopt this specific workflow, be creative
with your git branching strategies, and find the strategy that works for you.
