# Understanding `string.replace` in JavaScript

Finding and replacing with capture groups is super useful. I do it all the time
in vim using sed syntax. Here's an example!

## Scenario

Oh no, we're migrating to a new email provider, and they don't support the
`+custom` thing ([more one the email `+`
trick](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/6-clever-gmail-tricks-to-minimize-regret-frustration-and-spam/))

Input

```text
admin@mydomain.com
engineering+custom@mydomain.com
```

Vim / Sed Regex; _horribly cryptic, as usual_:

```text
%s/\(\w\+\)\(+\w\+\)\?@\(.*\)/\1@newdomain.com
```

Output:

```text
admin@newdomain.com
engineering@newdomain.com
```

This is all very fine and good. Using capture groups allowed us to separately
capture the base email from the `+custom` bit, then to lift that out of
the replace expression so that we can do our whole transformation in one go.

How can you embrace this magic in JavaScript, though; it seems like something
that would be useful for string manipulation!

## Using Capture Group Replacement in JavaScript

The gist of the API in javascript is that you can use `$1`, `$2`, etc. to refer
to to captured groups just like you can use `\1`, `\2`, etc. in vim or sed.

Unlike vim or sed, I was really surprised by this behavior:

<CodeSample>
```javascript
'input string'.replace(/(input)/, '$1') // 'input string'
```
</CodeSample>

<p className="
  font-extrabold
  text-xl
  text-transparent
  bg-clip-text
  bg-gradient-to-tr
  from-primary-500
  to-secondary-500
">JavaScript, whyyy do you do this?</p>

It turns out that with a partial match, finding and replacement only affects
the text for which it matched. So, we cannot touch the `' string'` substring at
all with the find and replace syntax here, since it wasn't captured by the
regular expression. In practice, that means we need at least two capture groups
to do anything useful.

<CodeSample>
```javascript
'input string'.replace(/(input) (string)/, '$1') // 'input'
```
</CodeSample>

We were able to remove `' string'` from the output because `$1` now only
captures `input`, but doesn't capture anything else.

We can use this pattern to do something sort of practical, actually.

<CodeSample>
```javascript
names = ["John Smith", "Mary Jane", "Tim Peters"]
names.map((name) => name.replace(/(\w+) (\w+)/, '$2, $1'))
// => [ 'Smith, John', 'Jane, Mary', 'Peters, Tim' ]
```
</CodeSample>

The key here is that the whole string matches the whole regex. If the string
doesn't match the regex at all, it doesn't matter what we put in the replace
expression, the original input is passed through unaffected. 

<CodeSample>
```javascript
"can't touch this".replace(/no match/, '$1')  
// => "can't touch this"

"can't touch this".replace(/no match/, '$2')  // "can't touch this"
// => "can't touch this"

"can't touch this".replace(/no match/, 'hello??')  
// => you guessed it; still "can't touch this"
```
</CodeSample>

The weird thing is that for a partial match, the bit that doesn't match gets
passed through, while you can transform the part that _does_ match. This
highlights the weirdness. First, let's breakdown the regex I'm going to use:

```text
/(\w+)@(\w+)\.(\w{3})/
```

In plain language, this is:

- A group of one or more letters (`$1`)
- An "`@`"
- A group of one or more letters (`$2`)
- A "`.`"
- A group of exactly 3 letters (`$3`)

As you might have started to recognize, this is an email regex. But, there's a
problem. It supports top-level domains with 3 chracters (".com"), but not ones
with two characters (".co"), which do exist! Therefore, we see the following:

<CodeSample>
```javascript
// this is the same regex as before; don't bother reading it üòÅ
const reg = /(\w+)@(\w+)\.(\w{3})/

reg.test('hi@hi.com') // true
reg.test('hi@hi.co')  // false
```
</CodeSample>

With that in mind, let's look at examples that combine everything we've
learned!

<CodeSample>
```javascript
const reg = /(\w+)@(\w+)\.(\w{3})/g // still the same!

// this is expected behavior; the regex matches exactly
'email@domain.com'.replace(reg, '$1') // 'email' (as we'd expect)
'email@domain.com'.replace(reg, '$2') // 'domain' (as we'd expect)
'email@domain.com'.replace(reg, '$3') // 'com' (as we'd expect)

// when the regex doesn't match the input is passed through! Just like the
// "can't touch this" example from before
'email@domain.co'.replace(reg, '$1')     // 'email@domain.co'
'email@domain.co'.replace(reg, '$2')     // 'email@domain.co'
'email@domain.co'.replace(reg, 'ahhhh')  // 'email@domain.co'
```
</CodeSample>

Let's look at some partial matches now!

<CodeSample>
```javascript
const reg = /(\w+)@(\w+)\.(\w{3})/g // still the same!

const falseInformation = 'My email domain is email@domain.com'
// uh, no, the domain is just "domain.com"; let's fix that with our regex!

const fixed = falseInformation.replace(reg, '$2.$3')
fixed === 'My email domain is domain.com' // true

let challenge = `
  For each of these emails, change the top-level domain from ".com" to ".gov"

  - myemail@website.com
  - theiremail@whatever.com
  - whosemail@something.org
  - thisemail@that.net
`;

// There are other ways to accomplish this without repetition; out of scope for
// this tutorial
challenge = challenge.replace(reg, '$1@$2.gov')
challenge = challenge.replace(reg, '$1@$2.gov')
challenge = challenge.replace(reg, '$1@$2.gov')
challenge = challenge.replace(reg, '$1@$2.gov')
```
</CodeSample>

So, basically, if we have an exact match, the behavior is pretty unsurprising.
If we don't have a match, the whole string just gets passed through. If we have
a partial match, javascript performs the transformation on the bit that
matched, but doesn't touch the rest.

Here are a few more examples.

<CodeSample>
```javascript
'hello world'.replace(/(hell)(o)/, '$1') // 'hell world'
```
</CodeSample>

And `$2` captures the `o`:

<CodeSample>
```javascript
'hello world'.replace(/(hell)(o)/, '$2') // 'o'
```
</CodeSample>

There are quite a few decent resources on the internet already, of course:

- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/n)
- [stack overflow; "JavaScript replace method, replace with "$1""](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3235785)
- [more detailed blog-style
  guide](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-regex/replace/)

Another important topic for understanding regex in JavaScript is regex modifier
flags, which I've ignored to keep it simple here, but [mdn documents them very
well](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags)
and I encourage you to experiment with them!
