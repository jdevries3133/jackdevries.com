# GitHub Workflow Tips for Beginners

<p className="italic text-mineral-500 text-sm"
>Note: I have a series of posts about git. For an intermediate workshop, see
[git some help.](./gitHelp)</p>

## Overview

This guide is mainly written with my [Code the
Dream (CTD)](https://codethedream.org/) mentoring students in mind, but many bootcamp
students or new open source contributors can benefit from these tips. First,
when I say "GitHub Workflow," I mean the typical lifecycle of changes whereby
an individual contributor gets their code into a git repository:

1. Make a local clone of the repo
2. Make a feature branch
3. Make a GitHub pull request, where you're requesting to merge your feature
   commits with the main branch of the repository
4. Code review occurs in the pull request
5. Your code is merged ðŸŽ‰

Note that this is the workflow at CTD is a bit different than your typical open
source workflow. Specifically, CTD students are branching from their own remote
repository, and simply applying self-imposed discipline to not commit to the
`main` branch, as a way of rehearsing the way that the process works in most
companies.

Meanwhile in open-source repos, you cannot generally create a branch on the
real project repository. Instead, you make a branch of your own remote copy of
the project repo, then request to pull your changes into the upstream
repository from your remote repository. This is a more complex setup, and
_not_ how it generally works at companies, which also why CTD does not teach
this workflow! However, if you are a CTD student and you've ever accidentally
made a pull request to merge your code into the CTD official clone of the
`node_express_course`, this is why! GitHub is optimized for the open source
contributing workflow, where your personal fork is the "landing zone" for
changes ultimately bound for the repository you forked from. If you click the
default "create PR" button, it will target CTD by default!

# Common Mistakes

OK, so what are these common mistakes we're going to address?

- Making a PR against the wrong repo
- Too many commits on a PR
- Commits include `node_modules` or other stuff we don't want

## Mistake 1: PR is Targeting the Wrong Repo

Let's say it loud for those in the back:

<HeroBg>
  <HeroText>
    You should be able to click &apos;merge&apos; on your Pull Request&#33;&#33;&#33;
  </HeroText>
</HeroBg>

And if you can't something's gone wrong!

For an example "bad" pull request, check out my own;
[#79](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/node-express-course/pull/79).
Technically, nothing is wrong here -- my intention is to actually contribute to
code the dream, not to merge this code into the main branch of my own
repository. But if you did this, it would be a mistake. You want your pull
requests to target _your own main branch!_

You cannot change this PR to target the correct branch. You will need to close
this PR and create a new one. First, let's create a new one; you can jump to
the "week N" branch on your local repository by clicking on the blue chip on
from the bad PR:

<Image
  src="/static/ctdGitTips1.webp"
  caption="Click the red box to jump to the branch with your changes"
  alt="Image showing where to click. As of writing, the screen reader should say 'jdevries3133/node-express-course:wk_3_review_notes' for the element you need to click on"
/>

Next, you'll find yourself on the page for your branch. This is the branch you
made with your changes (typically "`week2`" or similar). It looks like this,
and you should click contribute -> "Open Pull Request" to go onto the next
step:

<Image
  src="/static/ctdGitTips2.webp"
  caption='Click the red box, then "Open Pull Request"'
  alt='Look for a popup menu element with the text "Contribute"'
/>

Finally, we come upon the page where you done goofed the first time. There are
4 dropdowns, and you originally made a mistake by accepting the default value
in the first one. By default, it'll prompt you to make a PR against Code
The Dream's upstream repository, but you want to click that left-most dropdown,
and change it to be your own repository!

<Image
  src="/static/ctdGitTips3.webp"
  caption="Notice the source and target REPOSITORIES are the same; only the branches are different"
  alt="Image showing that the source and target repositories are the same; only the branches are different"
/>

That's it! Click "create PR," and you'll have a healthy PR. Don't forget to
tell your reviewer where to look, and to close the PR you accidentally made
against the Code the Dream repo!


## Too Many Commits on a PR
