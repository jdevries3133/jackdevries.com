# Another Neovim Config

I was recently motivated to cleanup my vim and neovim config, which included
migrating most of the neovim configuration to lua, and installing some popular
neovim packages that I hadn't had the chance to try yet. I originally started
using neovim back in the 0.4 days before native LSP and all of its descendants
came onto the scene.

The goal of this post is to be a ramp that can onboard a developer with zero
vim or neovim experience all the way up to the full neovim-as-an IDE experience
that makes it practical for me to use neovim 100% of the time. As such, I'll be
a bit opinionated as a means for providing some guard rails, but as always
there is almost never a single "correct" learning sequence, and as long as you
don't feel frustrated or confused, you're on the right path for you.

I won't try to persuade you to learn (neo)vim, but I'll just say that using
(neo)vim brings me immeasurable joy each day, and I hope that everyone can
experience the mind-tool connection that it provides. There are a lot of false
prophets of vim who say it will make you faster or give you some other
superhuman benefits. Maybe it will, but if you're that smart of a developer
that you can figure out how to do tasks faster, you probably could accomplish
the same thing with JetBrains and bash scripts. At its best, using neovim, to
me, feels like playing a musical instrument. It elicits a flow state and drives
my focus through the day, but most of all, it just makes me happy.

To that end, I hope that this guide helps you join me.

## `vim` vs `neovim`

This guide will share

as well as
[configurations for neovim.](https://github.com/jdevries3133/nvim_config)
As a newcomer, which editor to use, which plugins to choose, and the overall
path from zero to hero are muddy waters. At a user level, neovim is almost 100%
compatible with vim for all intents and purposes. Certain plugins might be
either incompatible or not in vogue in a particular community, but the overall
user experience _before_ plugins is comparable.

However, neovim has applied massive architectural changes compared to vim, and
neovim has added the lua scripting language as a successor to vim script.
Neovim is also a community-led open source project, whereas vim follows the
so-called "Benevolent Dictator for Life" model, where vim's founder Bram
Moolenaar makes final decisions about the future of the project, for
[better or worse.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29758549)

In any case, neovim's architectural improvements combined with lua as a
first-class scripting language have made extremely sophisticated plugins
easier to develop than ever, and the community is bustling to say the least. At
this point, popular neovim plugins are polished, consistent, and extremely
performant. Not only that, but since they're all implemented in neovim-flavored
lua, they provide APIs for extension, which means that plugin authors can
collaborate and rely on each others' plugins. It's truly the best of the open
source ecosystem at work.

I don't want to give plain old vim the cold shoulder, though. One of the
delightful things about going down the (neo)vim learning journey is that you
apparently never stop finding features that are both surprising and delightful,
and in my experience, a lot of these nuggets of gold exist in or are inherited
from vim. For example:

- Did you know that `g?<motion>` will rot13 encode text?
- Did you know that `gu<motion>` and `gU<motion>`, can convert
  text to lowercase or uppercase, respectively?
- Did you know you can open and edit a remote file without leaving vim with `:e
  scp://<user>@<host>//absolute/path/to/file.txt`
- Did you know that you can yank (`y`), change (`c`), or delete (`d`) text
  inside curly braces, parenthesis, or square braces with key sequences like:
  - `di{`: delete inside curly braces
  - `ci(`: change inside parenthesis
  - `yi[`: yank inside square brackets

That is a random smattering of functionality, but the idea that there are so
many random fun things like this to learn, and that they are available on every
Unix-like terminal you touch is the legacy of vim (and vi that came before).
I definitely don't sleep on plain-old vim.

Going forward, my vim config aims to be minimal and portable. There are some
plugins, but there is also a single fully-portable config file that can be
scp'd over to any remote machine to quickly bring a base-level of comfort. My
neovim config, on the other hand, has all the bells and whistles: fuzzy finder,
live grep, integrated debugger, language support, dynamically inlined lint
errors, intelligent syntax highlighting and folding, and more.

## How to Transition to (neo)vim

Again, there's clearly not a right or wrong way, but I think that it's
important to pace yourself and to avoid making choices that lead you towards a
huge dent in productivity all at once. Learning to do everything that you do as
a developer while keeping your fingers on the home row is quite an adjustment,
