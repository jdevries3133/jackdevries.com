along.

## History Lesson

The [Auth0 blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-javascript/) has a
great Javascript history lesson. In particular, it's important to understand
the co-evolution of browsers and transpilers. Here are a few highlights.

> ECMAScript 3 was released in December 1999.
>
> This version of ECMAScript spread far and wide. It was supported by all major
> browsers at the time, and continued to be supported many years later. Even
> today, some transpilers can target this version of ECMAScript when producing
> output. This made ECMAScript 3 the baseline target for many libraries, even
> when later versions of the standard where released.

The next section's TL;DR is that ES4 was a dumpster fire. It was very
ambitious, none of the browsers had the motivation to implement it, and all
progress on the Javascript language stalled from about 2000-2015. This was also
before Node.js, whose v1 release was 2011.

> ECMAScript 5: The Rebirth Of JavaScript
>
> After the long struggle of ECMAScript 4, from 2008 onwards, the community
> focused on ECMAScript 3.1. ECMAScript 4 was scrapped. In the year 2009
> ECMAScript 3.1 was completed and signed-off by all involved parties. ECMAScript
> 4 was already recognized as a specific variant of ECMAScript even without any
> proper release, so the committee decided to rename ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript
> 5 to avoid confusion.
>
> ECMAScript 5 became one of the most supported versions of JavaScript, and also
> became the compiling target of many transpilers. ECMAScript 5 was wholly
> supported by Firefox 4 (2011), Chrome 19 (2012), Safari 6 (2012), Opera 12.10
> (2012) and Internet Explorer 10 (2012).

In other words, we already know _today_ (11/1/2022) what will be released in
ES2023, and what is very likely to be included in ES2024. With
[babel](https://babeljs.io/), you can start using these new language features
right now. Babel can transform Javascript such that it will run using old
ECMAScript features, but you can write the new ones. This desire to use the
latest and greatest was one factor that motivated developers to accept the
complexity of a new build toolchain.

Also, ECMA is the European Computer Manufacturers Association. They arbitrarily
became the standards organization that decides what Javascript is; just like
how C is standardized by ANSI (American National Standards Institute), Unicode
is standardized by ISO (International Organization for Standards), et cetera.

## 2015: React & Javascript Framework Wars

Although the latest and greatest ECMAScript APIs were attractive, nothing was
as alluring a motivation for adopting build toolchains as React, Vue, Angular,
and the 4,353,643 other Javascript frontend frameworks that have risen (and
sometimes fallen) over the last 7 years.

Don't get me wrong,
[`String.prototype.matchAll`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/matchAll)
is cool and all, but there's _no version_ of ECMAScript where this is OK:

```javascript
const message = 'Hello, world!';

return (
  <div className="container">
    {message}
  </div>
)
```

In addition to turning ES2045 into ES1999, babel can also turn the above code
into the below code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const message = 'Hello, world!';

return React.createElement('div', { className: 'container' }, [message]);
```

Oh, I'm sorry, did you think it was React who delivered the magic that made
HTML-in-Javascript work? **Nope!** In fact, the rest of this story is
absolutely a story of composition. Each build tool has a narrow focus, and
together they create the experience that we know and <strike>hate</strike>
love.

## Create React App

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is a CLI tool for scaffolding
out boilerplate of a React application. The toolbox it uses to turn React code
into something you can ship to Internet Explorer 9 is likely the most common
one used in the react ecosystem, so let's learn its components.

The CRA stack is comprised of webpack, babel, sometimes typescript via
ts-loader, a bunch of webpack plugins, and a bunch of glue code scripts written
by the CRA team.

### [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

The picture on their home page is a great visual of what webpack does.

  alt="A visual of what webpack does; taking a tree of source files on the left and turning them into a static site tree on the right"
/>

Natively, webpack is basically a dumb compiler. The only thing it can do is
follow import statements in Javascript code, and glue those many source files
into a single bundle. It accomplishes that by taking your code and wrapping it
in some webpack code.

In the [companion repo's `webpack` subdirectory](https://github.com/jdevries3133/js_build_tooling),
there is a super minimal webpack usage, so you can see how webpack works.
Notice the difference in output for the `build:dev` versus `build:prod`
scripts.

### [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl)

As we said before, babel is the thing that transforms your Javascript code to
standardize it for all browser environments, and also to convert JSX to regular
Javascript. I linked to the babel compiler explorer above, so you can explore
exactly how babel works.

### `ts-loader` and Webpack Plugins

In the [`ts-loader` directory of the companion
repo](https://github.com/jdevries3133/js_build_tooling), you can see that we
create a webpack config for the first time, and add `ts-loader`, allowing
webpack to now transparently load typescript files, and allow interoperation
between javascript and typescript. Overall, webpack plugins create "magic
imports" in Javascript, where we can import any file type and webpack will do
magic behind the scenes.

The typescript compiler even has support for typing these "magic modules" that
often appear in the webpack world; although they were less fun and named the
feature ["ambient
modules"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#ambient-modules)

### Plain Typescript

It's also worth understanding that typescript is a thing in and of itself. You
don't need `ts-loader` and webpack for typescript. The [`typescript` directory
of the companion repo](https://github.com/jdevries3133/js_build_tooling) has an
example where we use typescript by itself.

### _A Bunch of Webpack Plugins and Glue_

Unfortunately, this is what bridges the gap between what we've discussed so
far, and create-react-app. CRA naively tries to hide this complexity from you,
but if you `npm run eject` on an app made with create-react-app it'll spill
that complexity right out into your codebase, giving you a gigantic glob of
garbage to try to maintain and understand.

This code is gnarly, and only seems to become worse over time as it inevitably
accumulates fire-extinguishing patches. However, we have covered all of the
core building blocks. To see a concrete example, let's use a 1st party webpack
plugin: `file-loader`. Again, look in the companion repo for
[`webpack_plugins_file_loader`](https://github.com/jdevries3133/js_build_tooling).

Here, the file loader includes a string to any imported files, and webpack also
deals with putting the included files into the `dist` folder, as well as
including a hash of the file in the outputted filename, which is useful for
cache invalidation when the file changes.

While we're at it, we will also need the webpack copy plugin to move an
`index.html` from the `src` to `dist` folder, and voila, we have a static site!

## Wrap-Up

This has been a summary of the Javascript build system typical of
create-react-apps. If you're creating a new Javascript app today, you're best
off using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a single-page static site, or
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a full-stack application. I'm sure that the
Babel + Webpack stack will have a lot of staying power for years to come.
Although we gripe about them, these tools are highly flexible and dynamic,
albeit low-level and burdensome at the same time -- a classic trade-off.
