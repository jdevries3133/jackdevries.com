# Regex in Vim

I'm not a regex genius, but with `:incsearch`, you can incrementally craft
quite complex regular expressions with immediate visual feedback. Here's an
example; the source file might look familiar if you read my ripgrep post üòÅ. A
video is worth 1000 words in this case.

<iframe
  width="100%"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ulEE0ddTKkA"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; fullscreen"
  allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Regexr](https://regexr.com/) is another popular website for working on regular
expressions, but vim + `:incsearch` is much faster for vim users.
