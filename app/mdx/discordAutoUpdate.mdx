# Auto Update Discord on Mac or Linux

I'm an infrequent Discord user, and I feel like I get stuck with endless
auto-updates every time I open the app. It's very simple to launch apps from
the command line, though, and therefore also easy to launch
Discord automatically at whatever frequency you want to keep it up to date with 
just a little bit of shell scripting.

### The Mac Script

If you have a Mac, this script will open Discord, run it for a set period of
time, and then close it again.

<CodeSample>
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# mac discord updater script. Run discord for $1 seconds, then close it

if [[ $1 == "-h" || $1 == "--help" ]]
then
    echo 'mac discord updater script. Run discord for $1 seconds, then close it'
fi

/Applications/Discord.app/Contents/MacOS/Discord > /dev/null &
DISCORD_PID=$!

sleep $1

kill $DISCORD_PID
```
</CodeSample>

In bash, `$1` is the first argument passed to the script, so you can run this
program like this:

```bash
bash ./discord_updater.sh 3
```

It will run Discord for 3 seconds, then close it.

### Linux Usage

On Linux, everything is the same except the path to the Discord executable. 
However, it won't be at `/Applications/Discord.app/Contents/MacOS/Discord`. It
will be somewhere else, and please leave a comment on this post if you figure
out where that location is.

### cron

Cron is a super helpful tool for running programs on a schedule. If you've
never heard of it, [here is a good overview.](https://kb.iu.edu/d/afiz)
This website is also super helpful for [setting cron
rules.](https://crontab.guru/)

Open up your crontab by running `crontab -e`, then add this line:


```
0 0 * * * bash /path/to/discord_update.sh
```

This will run the Discord update program every day at midnight. Just save and
exit to apply the crontab; your computer will also prompt you to allow the
crontab to be installed, and might ask you for your password. You can confirm
it worked by running `crontab -l`, which will show your current crontab. You
can add more jobs by just adding more lines if you think of more programs you'd
like to run on a schedule.
